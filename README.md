The 'Client' and 'Server' folders represent 2 parts of the application.

To run each of these please enters the next commands in the console:

1) Unside the 'server' folder :
npm install
node app.js
This command will run a local server on your machine and you will observe the corresponding message: "The server has started on port 3030". No manipulations required afterwards.

2) Inside the 'client' folder:
npm install
ng serve

This will run the client side on the port: 4200, so you can use the client interface.
